# Emulator

This emulator is based on the [Unicorn](https://www.unicorn-engine.org/) engine. It allows executing trustlets and hooking the tlApis/drApis. It can also print the instructions executed, the register values and the content of the stack. It is especially useful to debug exploits for trustlets/drivers.

## Installation

Simply install Unicorn and its Python bindings, are you're all good to go!
